            You can now upload a picture of yourself for your profile and
            also I changed the profile so that your squats/snatch/deadlift
            will be up to you to enter lbs or kgs.  I should've done this at
            first so I do apologize for the inconvienence.  Feel free to
            edit your profile accordingly.</h3>
