# wodtracker
Brad Goldsmith's attempt to create A WODtracker (Workout of the Day) for crossfit affiliates.  This application can be incorporated into existing affiliates websites/databases or can be used directly by individuals for keeping track of their progess.
I'll be using PHP/Laravel framework and MySQL database to make this work properly.  
This will be used as part of my coding bootcamps final project.  This is not the most complex coding ever, but it is very useful and I plan to have my box impliment it so hopefully by demo day it will have 100 actual live users.
